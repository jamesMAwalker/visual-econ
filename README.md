# Visual Econ

This is project is a data visualization application built with Next.js. Though this began a as a qucik take home exam, I have since expanded its featureset and used it to explore data visualization techniques.

## Getting Started

For the app to run properly, you'll need an API key from [bea.gov](https://apps.bea.gov/API/signup/).

The key should be assigned to an environment variable called "BEA_API_KEY".

Once your env file is set up, install the dependencies.

Now you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app in action!

## Testing

This app uses vitest for basic unit testing. Run the command below to test the application.

```bash
npm run test

npm run test:ui # opens test results in browser window

```
